3. Start the machine called `cs323-OS`.
4. There is an already created user `cs323` with password `cs323`.
5. There is a predefined port forwarding from your host port 2222 to the VM port 22. Hence, you don't need to work in graphical mode and can SSH into the VM with `ssh -p 2222 cs323@localhost`.

7. Within the VM, open the terminal either via SSH or GUI.
